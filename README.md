# The Dialogue Writer

Write dialogues...

## Current features

- write 2 person dialogues (speaker A and speaker B)
- save **up to 5** dialogues
- view list of saved dialogues
- load previous dialogues to continue working on them

## Why Local Storage

I chose local storage for two reasons. First, the purpose of this project was just to learn how to use ReactJS (this was my first react project).
Second, I also wanted to experiment with using local storage, but I definitely believe the project would be better with storage in a database.

**Pros**
- easy to implement

**Cons**
- dialogues only saved on individual devices

## Future plans
- implement a user login system
- use a database to store user dialogues instead of local storage
- allow users to name speakers
- allow dialogues with more than 2 speakers
